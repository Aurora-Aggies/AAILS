# AAILS

### Aurora Aggies' Intelligent Lighting System
This GitHub repository contains the code used to build the Aruroa Aggies' Intelligent Lighting System. This system, illuminated by LEDs, is primarily designed to adhere to living conditions for astronauts residing in a space station. It utilizes a circadian rhythm algorithm to promote health amongst people within the station as well as plants (future implementation). This system also contains RFID technology for ease of use across the station and incorporates several sophisticated functions and algorithms within the LED microcontroller. AAILS also features a RGB sensor to detect any degredation amongst the lights. All hardware will be connected to a local network server that runs our frontend and backend applications where data can run to and from the microcontrollers.
